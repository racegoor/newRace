            <p class="aboutText">Race is a very exciting game developed by Zipi & Zipi as part of final project of computer programing. the idea
                of the game came after Zipi A wanted to develop an application with Google Maps while Zipi B prefered to
                develop a game. The two friends tried to reach an agreement which ultimately produced this creative game.
                Game on Google's panorama is exciting and challenging. You can drive on familiar streets, from your home
                to friends or to school, and maybe even try to reach faraway foreign places. When was the last time you visited
                the Big Ben in London or toured the streets of Paris? Here you will be able to feel as if you are in the
                place you chose and you will get to know it better then its residents! </p>
